# react-brunch-demo

This is a demo for an HTML5 application, powered by [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) & [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), written in ES6 and built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and dependencies: `npm install`.
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with pushState.
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated. Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`. Ideal for images, fonts...
